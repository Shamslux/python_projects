# Python Projects

## Objectives

As a Data Engineer I am seeking develop more and more my skills with programming languages and I'm creating this repository to share some of my work with them. In this particular case, this is a repository about the Python scripts that I am creating for training.

# Script 1 - Extracting data from IBGE

While working for a Brazilian company, our client had the need to consume data from IBGE, a public organism in Brazil. One of their measures is called "IPCA" and the client needed this one, but not the value from the API, which showed only the monthly variation. The client wished a kind of cumulated value only found in a PDF file. So I started to think about a way to extract the desired data and structure it from unstructured data into structured data.

# Script 2 - A simple PDF to DOC converter

I had to sign a document that I had received online. I had to convert it to doc and I usually used to use those online converters, however, I found in this an opportunity for me to solve it using Python's resources. This script has a simple function to convert PDF into DOC using the module pdf2docx.
